**Planet Conqueror** is a Python game built using **Pygame**, inspired by the mobile game *Cell Expansion Wars*.  
The action takes place in outer space, where players conquer planets, launch satellites, and send units between worlds using upgradeable rockets.

The gameplay blends both **real-time** and **turn-based** mechanics, creating a unique and strategic experience.  
Levels are **procedurally generated**, ensuring a fresh challenge every time you play.

## How to play

- **Click on your planet** (green), then **click on an enemy or neutral (gray) planet** to create a connection and send units.
- **Drag a card** onto one of your planets to activate its effect.

Use quick thinking and tactical moves to outmaneuver your opponent and take over the galaxy!
